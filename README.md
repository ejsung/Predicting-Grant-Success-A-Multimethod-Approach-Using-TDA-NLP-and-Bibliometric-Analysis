## Overview

A data-driven exploration of historical DoD grant proposals submitted by University of Arizona faculty, combining:

- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA):** We quantify each proposal’s “diversity” using persistent homology and show that more focused strategies correlate with higher acceptance rates.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  A Transformer-based classifier trained on titles, keywords, and authors achieves ~70 % accuracy in predicting funded vs. unfunded proposals.
- **Bibliometric Modeling:** Logistic regression, random forest, and gradient-boosted trees built on h-index, i10-index and citation counts reach up to ~71 % accuracy, with total citations as the strongest predictor.

Our goal: uncover actionable patterns to improve future grant outcomes.
